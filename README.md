# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
We have analyzed the performance of each vendor to identify the poorly performing vendor & high-performance vendor. 
Our aim is to increase profit & reduce inventory management cost by analyzing the vendor performances.

Below are the steps that I have performed into the project:-

1. Data Collection:- We have created vendor summary table by fetching required columns from various tables like 	Purchases,	Purchase_prices,Sales,	Vendor_Invoice.
2. Data Cleaning & transformation:- In this step we have cleaned the data & created some new columns from the existing columns.
3. EDA( Exploratory Data Analysis):- We have derived some insights by performing the EDA.
4. Creation of the Power BI dashboard.
5. Report Writing:- In this section we have done storytelling from the data.

Below is the information of the files of the project:-

1. ingestion_db.ipynb --> Reading all CSV files & then storing them into the postgresql database tables.
2. get_vendor_summary.ipynb --> Creation of vendor_summary_table from the all tables. Then storing that table in postgresql.
3. EDA --> Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Vendor_Performance_dashboard --> Power BI dashboard.
5. Data Folder --> Contains all the CSV files of the data
6. Report Writing --> Final report of the analysis.
